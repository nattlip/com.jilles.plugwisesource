Homey app to integrate Plugwise Windows desktop Source in Homey.

Works with data retreived from Plugwise Source Server . Controls Circles with Homey.

30-08-2016 version 1.2 first app store release changes : only Circles and Circles+ can be added as Homey socket devices.
 
There is a special Homey app for the Plugwise Smile P1 in the Athom App Store so it isnt included anymore in this app.-://forum.athom.com/discussion/1906
