Homey app to integrate Plugwise Windows desktop Source in Homey.

Works with data retreived from Plugwise Source Server.

30-08-2016 version 1.2 first app store release changes : only Circles and Circles+ can be added as Homey socket devices. 
There is a special Homey app for the Plugwise Smile P1 in the Athom App Store so it isnt included anymore in this app
Bug fixed  : Testing Plugwise Source server  doesnt give crash app anymore.
